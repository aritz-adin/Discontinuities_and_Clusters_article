# Data
Two motivating applications are described in this work: stomach cancer mortality data in Spanish provinces during the year 2013, and brain cancer incidence data in 27 administrative regions of Navarre and
the Basque Country during the period 2000-2008.

- [**StomachCancer_ESP.Rdata**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Discontinuities_and_Clusters_article/blob/master/data/StomachCancer_ESP.Rdata)
  
  This .Rdata contains the following objects:
	- **_Data_**: `data.frame` object with the number of observed and expected cases (_'obs'_ and _'exp'_ variables, respectively) and standardized mortality ratio (_'SMR'_) for each province (_'prov'_) and time period (_'year'_) for stomach cancer mortality data.
	- **_Carto.ESP_**: `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` object with the cartography of the 47 continental Spanish provinces.
	- **_W_**: Spatial adjacency matrix of the Spanish provinces.


- [**BrainCancer_MUN.Rdata**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Discontinuities_and_Clusters_article/blob/master/data/BrainCancer_MUN.Rdata)
  
  This .Rdata contains the following objects:
	- **_Data.INCI_** and **_Data.MORT_**: `data.frame` objects with the number of observed and expected cases (_'obs'_ and _'exp'_ variables, respectively) and standardized incidence/mortality ratio (_'SMR'_) for each administrative region (_'region'_) and time period (_'year'_) for brain cancer incidence and mortality data.
	- **_Carto.COM_**: `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` object with the cartography of the 27 administrative regions of Navarre and the Basque Country.
	- **_W_**: Spatial adjacency matrix of the administrative regions.


# R code
R code to fit with INLA (http://www.r-inla.org/) the two-stage spatial and spatio-temporal models described in Adin et al. (2019). All the R files are written by the authors of the paper.

**1. Main files**

- [**Example1_Spatial_CountData.R**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Discontinuities_and_Clusters_article/blob/master/R/Example1_Spatial_CountData.R)

  R code to fit two-stage spatial cluster models using Spanish stomach mortality data (stored in `StomachCancer_ESP.Rdata` file). It reproduces the results obtained in Section 5.1. of the present work.
  
- [**Example2_SpatioTemporal_CountData.R**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Discontinuities_and_Clusters_article/blob/master/R/Example2_SpatioTemporal_CountData.R)

  R code to fit two-stage spatio-temporal cluster models using brain cancer incidence data in the regions of Navarre and Basque Country (stored in `BrainCancer_MUN.Rdata` file). It reproduces the results obtained in Section 5.2. of the present work.
  
**2. Algorithms**

- [**AHC_function.R**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Discontinuities_and_Clusters_article/blob/master/R/AHC_function.R)
